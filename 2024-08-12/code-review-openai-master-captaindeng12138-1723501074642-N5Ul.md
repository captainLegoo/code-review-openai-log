The provided `git diff` record shows the differences between two versions of the Java class `Outlook`, which is a part of an email infrastructure system in a project named `code-review-openai-sdk`. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. **Line 28 and 29 (old version)**:
   - `String host = "outlook.office365.com";`
   - `int port = 993;`

   These two lines specify the SMTP server host and port for sending emails using Outlook. The host is set to `outlook.office365.com`, which is the standard SMTP server for Outlook 365, and the port is set to 993, which is commonly used for secure IMAP connections.

2. **Line 28 and 29 (new version)**:
   - `String host = "smtp-mail.outlook.com";`
   - `int port = 587;`

   In the new version, the host has been changed to `smtp-mail.outlook.com`, which is also a valid SMTP server for Outlook, but it is more commonly used for SMTP connections. The port has been changed to 587, which is the standard port for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) connections.

Here are some observations and considerations for the code changes:

- **Server Host Change**: The change from `outlook.office365.com` to `smtp-mail.outlook.com` might be due to a preference for using the SMTP server over the IMAP server, or it could be a specific requirement by the Outlook service provider or client configuration.

- **Port Change**: The change from port 993 to 587 indicates a transition from using an encrypted IMAP connection (port 993) to a plain SMTP connection (port 587). Port 587 is used for unencrypted SMTP traffic, which is typically less secure but simpler to configure for basic email sending.

- **Properties Initialization**: After the port change, the next line in the diff (`String senderName = "OpenAI Code Review";`) and the line following it (`Properties props = new Properties();`) suggest that there might be additional setup for the email properties, possibly related to the SMTP connection.

- **Security Considerations**: Using port 587 (SMTP) instead of port 993 (IMAP) might have implications for email sending security. Ensure that any sensitive information is handled securely and that encryption options are considered if the email content is sensitive.

- **Code Review**: When reviewing the code, it's important to verify the following:
  - The email service credentials and configuration are secure and follow best practices.
  - The change in port usage does not affect the application's security or functionality.
  - The new SMTP server and port are correctly supported by the Outlook service and that any changes to the configuration do not require additional steps or credentials.
  - The code change is documented, explaining the reasons for the switch to `smtp-mail.outlook.com` and port 587.

Please note that the `git diff` record does not include the entire code of the class, so this review is based solely on the provided diff.
