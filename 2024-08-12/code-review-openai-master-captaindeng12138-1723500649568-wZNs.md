The `git diff` record you've provided indicates that there have been changes to the `Outlook` class file within the `code-review-openai-sdk` project. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **Email Host Update**: The host for the SMTP server has been changed from `"smtp.office365.com"` to `"smtp-mail.outlook.com"`. This is a significant change as it could affect the email sending functionality, as the SMTP server address is crucial for email transmission.

2. **Removed Print Statements**: The print statements that were previously present to display `senderPassword` have been removed. This is a good security practice since exposing passwords in logs can lead to security breaches.

3. **Added `senderName`**: A new variable named `senderName` has been added to the class, with an initial value of `"OpenAI Code Review"`. This could be used to set the sender's name when sending an email, which can be a useful feature for branding or identification purposes.

Here are some considerations and recommendations:

- **Testing**: Ensure that the updated SMTP host is correct and that the class still functions as expected after the change. Since the host has been updated, it's essential to test the email sending functionality to confirm that emails are being sent without issues.

- **Security**: The removal of the `senderPassword` print statement is good practice. However, make sure that the password is securely stored and handled within the application, following best security practices.

- **Documentation**: Update any documentation that references the old SMTP host or the use of the password print statements to reflect the changes made.

- **Configuration**: Consider whether the `senderName` variable should be configurable or if the default value is acceptable. If configurable, you might want to add a constructor parameter or a setter method for this variable.

- **Error Handling**: Review the error handling around email sending to ensure that any issues with the new SMTP server are properly caught and logged.

Remember that the diff output does not include the entire code, so these are general suggestions based on the changes reported.
