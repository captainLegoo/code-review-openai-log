The `git diff` output you've provided shows a change in a Java file named `GitCommand.java` within the `code-review-openai-sdk` project. The file is located in the `src/main/java/cn/dcy/review/sdk/infrastructure/git` directory. The diff indicates that there was a commit with an ID between `e92d496` and `94e6099`.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

### Old Code:
```java
public class GitCommand {
    // ... (other code)

    public String getReviewLogUrl(String fileName) {
        // ... (other code)
        logger.info("openai code review log has been pushed to GitHub! {}", fileName);
        return githubReviewLogUrl + "/tree/main" + dateFolderName + "/" + fileName;
    }

    // ... (other code)
}
```

### New Code:
```java
public class GitCommand {
    // ... (other code)

    public String getReviewLogUrl(String fileName) {
        // ... (other code)
        logger.info("openai code review log has been pushed to GitHub! {}", fileName);
        return githubReviewLogUrl + "/tree/main/" + dateFolderName + "/" + fileName;
    }

    // ... (other code)
}
```

### Changes Made:
- A single backslash (`\`) has been removed from the URL string in the `getReviewLogUrl` method. The original line concatenates the path components without a trailing slash, while the modified line adds a trailing slash (`/`) before the `dateFolderName`.

### Implications of the Change:
- The primary impact of this change is the addition of a trailing slash in the URL path. This is a stylistic change that is often done to ensure consistency or to adhere to specific URL conventions.
- The addition of the trailing slash might have implications for the behavior of the application when dealing with URLs. For example, some web servers or libraries may interpret a URL with a trailing slash differently from one without a trailing slash, potentially affecting the navigation or linking behavior.
- It is important to verify that this change does not inadvertently break any existing functionality or tests that rely on the original URL structure.

### Recommendations:
- Ensure that this change is intentional and that it does not lead to any unexpected behavior in the application.
- If this is a stylistic change, it should be consistent throughout the codebase.
- If this is a correction to ensure proper URL structure, verify that all other similar URLs in the codebase are consistent.
- Test the application thoroughly after this change to ensure that it still functions as expected.
