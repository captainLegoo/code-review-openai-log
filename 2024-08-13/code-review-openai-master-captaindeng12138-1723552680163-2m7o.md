The provided git diff record shows a change to the `Outlook` class, which implements the `Email` interface in a Java project located at `code-review-openai-sdk/src/main/java/cn/dcy/review/sdk/infrastructure/inform/email/impl/Outlook.java`. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

**Deleted Line:**
- `props.put("mail.smtp.secure", false);`
This line has been commented out. It appears that the original code was setting the `mail.smtp.secure` property to `false`, which would indicate that the SMTP connection is not encrypted. This is generally not recommended for security reasons, as it could allow for eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Added Line:**
- `//props.put("mail.smtp.secure", false);`
This line is a comment indicating that the line above was intended to set the `mail.smtp.secure` property to `false` but has been commented out. It is unclear why this line was commented out in the commit, but it could be an oversight or a deliberate decision.

**Modified Line:**
- `message.setFrom(new InternetAddress(senderEmail, senderName));`
This line has been changed from including both the email address and the sender's name to only including the email address. The previous code set both the `Address` and the `Personal` fields of the `InternetAddress` object, which could be used to specify the email address and the display name of the sender. The new code only sets the email address.

Here are some considerations for each change:

1. **Security**: The removal of the `mail.smtp.secure` property suggests a potential security risk, as it would leave the connection unencrypted. It's important to ensure that email communication is secure to protect sensitive data. If the comment is a mistake, it should be removed to enable encryption. If it's intentional, it should be clearly documented why this decision was made.

2. **Sender Name**: Removing the sender's name from the `setFrom` method could affect how the email is displayed in the recipient's email client. It's important to consider if this change in behavior is desired or if it was an oversight.

3. **Code Review**: During code review, it's essential to ask the developer why these changes were made and whether they were intentional. If they were not intentional, the developer should be asked to revert the changes or provide a justification for them.

4. **Documentation**: Ensure that any changes to configurations or behaviors are well-documented, especially if they deviate from expected or secure practices. This is crucial for maintainability and for future developers who may work with this codebase.

Remember that these are just suggestions based on the diff record, and the actual implications depend on the specific context and requirements of the application.
