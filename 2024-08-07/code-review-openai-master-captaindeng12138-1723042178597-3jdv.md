Based on the `git diff` record provided, here is a review of the changes made to the `OpenAiCodeReviewService` class in the `code-review-openai-sdk` project:

### Changes:

1. **Import Statements**:
   - New imports for `ChatGLModel` and `ChatGPTModel` classes have been added at the top of the file. This suggests that the code may be using these classes to set the model for the OpenAI API request.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - The original model `ChatGPTModel.GPT_4_O_MINI.getCode()` has been commented out (`//request.setModel(ChatGPTModel.GPT_4_O_MINI.getCode());`).
   - A new model `ChatGLModel.GLM_4_FLASH.getCode()` is being set instead. This change indicates that the service is now using a different model for code review, possibly because of performance, accuracy, or specific requirements.

3. **Message Content**:
   - The message content has been changed from Chinese to English. The prompt has been updated to:
     ```
     You are a senior programming architect, proficient in various scenarios, architecture design and programming languages. Please review the code according to the git diff record. The code is:
     ```
   - This change suggests that the service is now intended to be used in an environment where English is the primary language.

### Code Review:

- **Import Statements**: Ensure that `ChatGLModel` and `ChatGPTModel` are correctly implemented and that their usage is consistent throughout the codebase.
- **Model Selection**: Investigate why the `GPT_4_O_MINI` model was commented out and the new `GLM_4_FLASH` model was chosen. Consider the implications of this change on the code review process.
- **Message Content**: The change to English makes sense if the target audience is primarily non-Chinese speakers. However, ensure that the prompt is clear and that the service is correctly interpreting the diff code.
- **Exception Handling**: Check how exceptions are handled in the `codeReview` method. Ensure that any exceptions thrown during the code review process are appropriately caught and handled.
- **Documentation**: Review the class and method documentation to ensure it accurately reflects these changes, especially the reason for switching models and the change in language.
- **Testing**: Verify that the service still functions correctly with the new model and message content. Automated tests should be run to ensure that the code review service behaves as expected.

Overall, the changes seem to be related to improving the service's usability and potentially the quality of the code review. However, a thorough investigation is required to ensure that these changes do not introduce any new issues or impact the service's performance.
